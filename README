A simple program to detect TCP segments rearrangement method of remote OS.


An echo server running on remote OS is needed.
To get a Linux echo sever, you can use echo.c. To compile it, just "make echo".
To detect Windows, you can use echo_win.cpp. I'm not familiar with windows
network programming. So echo_win.cpp is modified from web and not included in
Makefile.


The detector runs in Linux.
libpcap and libdnet is needed.


I used it to test Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu, Win XP and Win 7.
All Linux distributions favor after(suffix).
Win 7 favors old.
It was intersting that Win XP differed from Win 7. But I dont remember clearly
what Win XP was. Maybe after.

When I ran the test, Win 8 hadn't come. And I dont try Win 8 until now.
